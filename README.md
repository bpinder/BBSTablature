BBSTablature
============

A modification of the Belle, Bonne, Sage library to support the rendering of guitar tablature. 

After running the project, try loading a file from the "XML Files" folder. 
By changing the "display" attribute in the "stringInstr" element near the 
top of each xml file to either 0, 1 or 2, the display will change as follows:

0: Just notation will be displayed
1: Just tablature will be displayed
2: Both notation and tablature will be displayed
